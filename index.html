<h1>Title: AI Music Videos</h1>

<p>Have a favorite song but no music video to go along with it? This Project aims to take any kind of song (preferably with lyrics) and generate a music video for it.
The model would consider things such as rhythm, ideas represented in the lyrics, and overall tone of the music. 
It is exciting to see how the ideas portrayed by music can be interpreted by a model, especially considering how some songs can differ so greatly
between the emotion of the music and the lyrics. Success in this project would be the generation of a video that is the same length as the song 
and can correlate to the meaning or emotion of the song in any way.</p>

<p>Project Goals:</p>
1. Be able to determine major ideas in lyrics
2. Identfiy emotion of music
3. Combine lyrics and music into a usable prompt
4. Have the video resemble the rhythm or bpm of the song
